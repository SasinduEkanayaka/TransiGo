# AdminDashboardScreen KPIs Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to the AdminDashboardScreen with real-time data from Firestore.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **AdminDashboardRepository.kt** - Handles Firestore queries for dashboard statistics
2. **AdminDashboardViewModel.kt** - Manages dashboard state and data flow
3. **DriverRepository.kt** - Basic driver repository for driver queries

### Modified Files:
1. **AdminDashboardScreen.kt** - Updated with KPI cards and improved UI
2. **FirebaseModule.kt** - Added DI providers for new repositories

## Features Implemented

### KPI Cards Display:
- **Total Bookings** (all time) - Shows total count of all bookings
- **Bookings Today** - Shows bookings created today using date range filters
- **Completed This Month** - Shows completed bookings for current month
- **Active Drivers** - Shows count of active drivers (isActive = true)
- **Pending Requests** - Shows count of bookings with REQUESTED status

### UI Improvements:
- Grid layout for KPI cards
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Error handling with dismissible error messages
- Refresh button to update statistics
- Responsive design with proper spacing
- Compact action buttons for navigation

### Repository Features:
- Asynchronous data fetching with Kotlin coroutines
- Parallel execution of multiple queries for better performance
- Proper error handling and Result wrapper pattern
- Date range filtering for today and current month statistics

## Required Firestore Indexes

The following composite indexes need to be created in Firestore:

### Index 1: Bookings by Date Range
```
Collection: bookings
Fields: requestedAt (Ascending), __name__ (Ascending)
```

### Index 2: Completed Bookings by Date Range
```
Collection: bookings
Fields: status (Ascending), requestedAt (Ascending), __name__ (Ascending)
```

### Index 3: Active Drivers
```
Collection: drivers
Fields: isActive (Ascending), __name__ (Ascending)
```

### Index 4: Bookings by Status
```
Collection: bookings
Fields: status (Ascending), __name__ (Ascending)
```

## Usage

The AdminDashboardScreen now automatically loads and displays:
1. Real-time dashboard statistics
2. Refresh capability
3. Error handling
4. Navigation to booking and driver management

## Performance Considerations

- All statistics are loaded in parallel for faster response
- Uses efficient Firestore queries with proper indexing
- Implements proper loading states to improve user experience
- Error handling prevents app crashes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Real-time updates using Firestore listeners
- Additional KPIs (revenue, ratings, etc.)
- Time period selection (weekly, monthly, yearly views)
- Export functionality for reports
- Charts and visualizations
